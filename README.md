#Task

Create a simple application that can be used for calculation of the cost from a housing loan. The application should have a simple user interface where the user can specify the desired amount and the payback time in years.
For simplicity, we assume a fixed interest of 3.5% per year during the complete payback time. The interest should be connected to the loan type in such a manner that different loan types can have different interests.
When selecting amount and payback time, the application should generate a monthly payback plan based on the series loan principle, i.e. you pay back an equal amount each month and add the generated interest. The interest is calculated every month.

The application should be made in such a manner that it can easily be extended to calculate a payment plan for other types of loans, for instance, car loans, spending loan, etc. with different interests. Also bear in mind that it should be easy to extend the application to cover other payback schemes as well. We do not expect this to be implemented.

You can decide which programming language to use. We expect to receive a database model, full source and screens.
